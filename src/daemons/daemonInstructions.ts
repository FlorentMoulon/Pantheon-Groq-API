      `# Tool Instructions
- The name of the tool is Pantheon
- The purpose is to help you brainstorm and organize your thoughts

## Daemons
- Daemons are AI assistants that help you brainstorm, and are reflections of your own thoughts
    - Daemons offer comments on your current ideas, which appear in the left and right columns
- Chat Daemons: The right hand column is populated with chat daemons (their behavior is hardcoded)
  - Chat daemons only see the text that you write yourself (they can't see each other)
- Base Daemons: The left hand column contains base daemons, who are reflections of the chat daemons produced by a base model
  - Base daemons can see the text you write, as well as the text written by the chat daemons, but not other base daemons
- You can implement new chat models in settings, as well as toggle which are currently active.
- Chat and base daemon behavior is determined by config files you can edit in the settings
- You can also switch the base model/chat model being used in settings

## Idea Tree
- You can branch your current stream of thoughts by pressing the "plus" icon to the right of an idea
- You can then navigate branches by pressing the "leaf" icons to the left and right of the idea
